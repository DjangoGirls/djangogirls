This repository contains sources of Django application that powers [DjangoGirls.org](http://djangogirls.org/).

## What's in it?

It's a simple CMS that contains 4 models:

- __Event__ - a list of events and their website configuration
- __EventPageContent__ - blocks of content that are visible on the website
- __EventPageMenu__ - items of menu of every website

## How to create new event?

Simply go to command line and run this command:

    python ./manage.py new_event

And then follow the instructions.

## How to manage your website?

### Event

- Meta tags - title and description of the website
- Main color - main color on the website in HEX (default is FF9400)
- Custom CSS - customize CSS on the website
- URL - url that goes after the domain (http://djangogirls.org/__url__)

### EventPageContent

http://djangogirls.org/admin/core/eventpagecontent/

Each website comes with some default content that you can adjust to your needs. Each object is a "block" on the website that you can modify in following ways:
- Name - it's also a permalink that you can link to like this: __#name__
- Content - HTML is allowed
- Background - there are two available types of blocks: without background and with background. By uploading image you're choosing the type with background.
- Is public - check this if you want this block to be visible

# Contributing to Django Girls website

The website is hosted on PythonAnywhere and is available here: http://djangogirls.org/

Please note that we use Python 3 only, so make sure that you use correct version when running commands below.

## Setting up a development environment

First, clone the repository:

    git clone git@github.com:DjangoGirls/djangogirls.git

Step into newly created `djangogirls` directory:

    cd djangogirls

Create a new virtual environment if needed. Then, install all the required dependencies:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Start the [PostgreSQL database server](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/server-start.html) and enter the `psql` shell (you need to have [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/download/) installed):

    psql

In the `psql` shell, create a database and a role with the necessary permissions:

    CREATE DATABASE djangogirls;
    CREATE ROLE postgres;
    GRANT ALL privileges ON DATABASE djangogirls TO postgres;
    ALTER ROLE postgres WITH LOGIN;

Exit the `psql` shell:

    \q

Run the migration to create database schema:

    ./manage.py migrate

Load sample data to the database

    ./manage.py loaddata sample_db.json

Create a user so you can login to the admin:

    ./manage.py createsuperuser

Install dependencies for static files:

    npm install

Compile CSS and JS files:

    gulp watch

Run your local server:

     ./manage.py runserver

:tada: You're done.


## Run the tests

You can run the tests like this:

	py.test

Or if you want coverage reports:

	py.test --cov


For a coverage report with information about missing lines, run this:

	py.test --cov-report term-missing --cov

### Static files

We're using a [Stylus](http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/) as our CSS pre-processor. [Get styling with Stylus](http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/#get-styling-with-stylus).

This means you shouldn't change any css files, but `.styl` files. They're in /static/source/css/ directory.

Autocompiling of `.styl` files to `.css`:

    gulp watch

We're also using gulp for our static files builds. To build static files for production, run this:

    gulp build

For local development:

    gulp local


### Hosting on PythonAnywhere

Key bits of config and secrets are stored in environment variables in two places:

* in the WSGI file (linked from the Web Tab)
* in the virtualenv postactivate at ~/.virtualenvs/djangogirls.com/bin/postactivate


### Google Apps API integration

We're using Google Apps Admin SDK for creating email accounts in djangogirls.org domain automatically.

Several things were needed to get this working:

1. Create an app in Developer Console
2. Create a service account to enable 2 legged oauth (https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2ServiceAccount)
3. Enable delegation of domain-wide authority for the service account.
4. Enable Admin SDK for the domain.
5. Give the service account permission to access admin.directory.users service (https://admin.google.com/AdminHome?chromeless=1#OGX:ManageOauthClients).
