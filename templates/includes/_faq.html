                        A: You want to attend a workshop happening in your city? So cool! You can register on the event's website.
                        If there is no website, it means that registrations are not opened yet. Come back in a few days to check or
                        send an email to the local organizers of the workshop you want to attend.

                        A: Sadly, you won't be able to apply: events receive many applications and already have a waiting list in case an
                        attendee has to cancel. You can subscribe to our <a href="{{ newsletter_url }}">newsletter</a> to know where
                        the next events are planed.

                        If you need assistance while doing the tutorial, go to <a href="https://gitter.im/DjangoGirls/tutorial/">Django Girls Gitter room</a>:
                        a group of volunteers is waiting for you there and will be happy to answer all your questions ;)
