                            Our upcoming initiative, a 12 to 16-week coding bootcamp, is an ambitious extension of this mission. 
                            This program, tailored specifically for women, is designed to provide comprehensive training in web 
                            development; covering HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and Django. In addition to technical skills, 
                            the bootcamp will focus on professional development, allowing participants to work on personal and 
                            open-source projects.

                            a bootcamp; you are investing in the future of technology, making it more diverse, inclusive, and 
                            innovative.
