                <p>We are 10 years now, yay and we are fundraising!</p>
                <p>Since the first Django Girls workshop in July 2014, we grew unexpectedly fast and we could not sustain that growth without some help.</p>

                <p>In 2015, we introduced a part-time paid position of Awesomeness Ambassador to help provide support to hundreds of volunteers all over 
                    the world.</p>
                   
                <p>In 2017, we also introduced the part-time paid position of Fundraising Coordinator to help us raise funds to run our activities. 
                    In 2023, we introduced the part-time paid position of Communications Officer to help us increase outreach following the pandemic 
                    and increase the number of workshops. We also introduced the Chief Emoji Officer (Managing Director) role, increasing the number 
                    of our paid staff.</p>

                <p>Our mission for 2024 is to improve outreach and visibility following the pandemic which saw a reduction in the number of 
                    workshops being organized per year. We have therefore introduced a new part-time Communications Officer to help us achieve 
                    this. We will also continue working with the advisory board to tackle diversity and inclusion issues in our systems and 
                    workshop guidance to ensure that voices of all people, especially those from marginalized communities, can contribute to 
                    our future. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Help us see this through. Support our work!
