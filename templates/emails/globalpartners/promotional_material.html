    <p>Hello {{ contact_person.split.0 }},</p>

    <p>Thank you for supporting our work.</p>

    {% if sponsor_level == "Bronze" and prospective_sponsor %}
    <p>May I please have your company logo and a short write-up for 
        announcing you as our sponsor on social media, and any company pictures you may have?</p>
    {% elif prospective_sponsor %} 
    <p>May I please have your company logo, company pictures and a short write-up on your company so I can do a blog post 
        announcing you as our global sponsor as well as for use in our periodic tweets on our sponsors?</p>
    <p></p>
    {% else %}
    <p>For our existing sponsors, we can either announce them again or offer them the chance to publish a guest post on our blog.
        If you have a post you would like featured on our blog, you can send it to me and we can post it on your behalf if it
    meets our <a href="https://djangogirls.org/coc/en/">Code of Conduct</a>.</p>
    {% endif %}

    <p>Once again, thank you for supporting our work.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Sparkles, cupcakes and high-fives, 🎉🎊🎉✨🍰👋</p>
