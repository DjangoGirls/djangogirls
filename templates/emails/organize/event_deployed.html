<h3>3) Organizers community</h3>
<p>
    Django Girls has a growing community of more than 300 organizers.
    You should receive an invitation to join a private group on Google Groups and 
    Slack -- this is where you can chat with other organisers, ask for their 
    help or advice. Use it wisely and plenty!
</p>

<h3>4) Postponing or canceling</h3>

<p>
    If you need to cancel or postpone your event, it’s not a problem at all! 
    Please let us know by sending an email and we’ll help.
</p>

<h3>5) Workshop Box</h3>

<p>
    To help you reduce the cost of your event, we created a Workshop Box 
    full of Django Girls stickers, name tags, badges and golden letter balloons. 
    You can order it through our store. To be sure it arrives on time, order 
    it at least 6 weeks before your event.
</p>

<h3>6) Django Girls shop discount code</h3>

<p>
    Django Girls has a t-shirt and socks online store! Use 
    {{ settings.STORE_DISCOUNT_CODE }} to get a 15% discount on your order. 
    You can share this code with your coaches and attendees as well. 
    All proceeds will go to Django Girls Foundation to make the charity 
    sustainable.
</p>

<h3>7) Need more help?</h3>

<p>
    Don’t forget about Organiser’s FAQ, Manual or to post questions 
    to our Google Group of Django Girls Organizers or Slack channel 
    - there are always more people there that can help you! :)
</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>

<p>
Hugs, rainbows and sunshines!<br/>
