Hi there!

Congrats! I just created your Django Girls chapter website & email.

1) Email

Your e-mail is {{ event.email }}

Login here: http://mail.djangogirls.org/

{{ event.email }} (@djangogirls.com works too!)
===ADD PASSWORD HERE===

You can also add this inbox to your email client:
- IMAP: imap.gmail.com (SSL, port 993)
- SMTP: smtp.gmail.com (SSL, port 465)

Or you can forward incoming mail to your private email account by following these instructions: http://gappstips.com/gmail/automatically-forward-emails-to-multiple-recipients-in-gmail/

2) Website

Your website address is http://djangogirls.org/{{ event.eventpage.url }}

Login here:
http://djangogirls.org/admin/
{% for member in members %}{{ member.first_name }} - email: {{ member.email }} password: {{ member.password }}
{% endfor %}
Your website is currently hidden for public, you can only see it if you’re logged in. If you want to make it available for everyone, go here: http://djangogirls.org/admin/core/eventpage/ and edit your website changing “is live” option.

Instructions on editing website: http://organize.djangogirls.org/website/

3) Your event in Django Girls Dispatch

When you open the registrations for your event, send us an email at hello@djangogirls.com so we can announce it in the Django Girls bi-weekly newsletter.

4) Postponing or canceling

If you need to cancel or postpone your event, please, send us an email. It can happen and we won't be mad at you ;) Also, if you're stuck on something, we can try to help you!

We wrote an FAQ (http://organize.djangogirls.org/faq/index.html) but don't hesitate to let me know if you need anything. It’s usually faster to post questions to our Google Group of Django Girls Organizers or Slack channel - there are more people that can help you! :)

Hugs, rainbows and sunshines!
