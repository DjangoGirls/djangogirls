Hi there!

Congrats! I just created your Django Girls chapter website & email.

1) Email

Your e-mail is {{ event.email }}

Login here: http://mail.djangogirls.org/

{{ event.email }} (@djangogirls.com works too!)
===ADD PASSWORD HERE===

You can also add this inbox to your email client:
- IMAP: imap.gmail.com (SSL, port 993)
- SMTP: smtp.gmail.com (SSL, port 465)

Or you can forward incoming mail to your private email account by following these instructions: http://gappstips.com/gmail/automatically-forward-emails-to-multiple-recipients-in-gmail/

2) Website

Your website address is http://djangogirls.org/{{ event.eventpage.url }}

Login here:
http://djangogirls.org/admin/
{% for member in members %}{{ member.first_name }} - email: {{ member.email }} password: {{ member.password }}
{% endfor %}
Your website is currently hidden for public, you can only see it if you’re logged in. If you want to make it available for everyone, go here: http://djangogirls.org/admin/core/eventpage/ and edit your website changing “is live” option.

Instructions on editing website: http://organize.djangogirls.org/website/

Let me know if you need anything. It’s usually faster to post questions to our Google Group of Django Girls Organizers or Slack channel - there are more people that can help you! :)

Hugs, rainbows and sunshines!
