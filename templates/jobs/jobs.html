                       Working as a software developer is a great way to become one.
                       There are lots of companies out there who are hiring,
                       but how can you tell which ones are good? We have talked
                       to a lot of them and here you can find offers from companies
                       who hire beginners and want to train them. They’re not targeting women only,
                       but they do care about diversity in a workplace. We trust they do the right things.

                       On this page we only list offers that require no experience, from companies who
                       want to hire beginners and care about diversity.
