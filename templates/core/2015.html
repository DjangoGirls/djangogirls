                      Financial fundraising for Django Girls began in February 2015, when we started our <a href="https://www.patreon.com/djangogirls">Patreon campaign</a> 
                        and budget tracking. In June 2015 we incorporated the non-profit <a href="https://djangogirls.org/foundation/">Django Girls Foundation</a> in England. 
                        While we're still working on the best way to present our finances, here is a first step: aggregated data about our expenses and income in 2015.

                      In total, <span>we spent $6,095.80 USD in 2015</span>. The <a href="https://djangogirls.org/pages/awesomness-ambassador/">Awesomeness Ambassador</a> position 
                        encompassed the majority (70%) of all of our costs. The Awesomeness Ambassador is responsible for running the daily operations of the organization: 
                        responding to organizer's requests, handling our mail, doing administrative tasks, updating the blog and newsletter, and maintaining the website and resources.

                      Another significant cost was sending some Django Girls team members to EuroPython, but that cost was entirely offset by a generous grant 
                      from Divio. Their sponsorship completely covered the cost of sending 3 of Django Girls team members to EuroPython in Spain.

                        Make the Django Girls Foundation sustainable by growing our monthly recurring income to cover recurring costs.
                        Currently, we need at least $1,500 a month to cover the costs of accounting, the Ambassador's salary, 
                        and the cost of other services we're using to maintain the website. We want to grow this revenue by focusing 
                        more effort on our <a href="https://www.patreon.com/djangogirls">Patreon campaign</a>, reaching 
                        out to more organizations with a fundraising deck, and establishing a permanent online merchandise store.

                                At the very beginning of the year, Ola & Ola decided that they need help to keep growing Django Girls, and 
                                invited <a href="http://blog.djangogirls.org/post/108268319658/django-girls-core-team-grows">Ania & Baptiste to form a Support Team</a> 
                                (back then called a core team). This is when the first formal processes for creating new events, adding new organizers, and making 
                                decisions were established. We began documenting those processes in a tiny <a href="https://github.com/DjangoGirls/wiki">wiki</a>.

                                The first quarter kept us busy with wonderful people knocking to our doors, asking us if they can help with translating the tutorial. 
                                We chose <a href="https://crowdin.com/project/django-girls-tutorial">Crowdin</a> as our translation platform, and began a never-ending 
                                process of figuring out how this translation thing even works. The Polish translation was the first one to be published that year!

                                The end of winter was marked with a Django Girls booth at PyCon US. We had a wonderful time answering everyone's questions and spreading the word about

                              We focused on improving our organizer's tools. Thanks to the hard work of our volunteers, we've seen some incredible contributions 
                              to our <a href="http://organize.djangogirls.org/">Organizer's Manual</a>. We also built an Applications tool for organizers 
                              that finally allows them to receive and score applications through the Django Girls website, instead of Google Forms and Spreadsheets. Phew!

                              Kasia and Geoffrey</a>. This also kicked off a process of increasing our transparency efforts. We spent a significant amount of time writing new documentation and improving 
                              current internal docs, and then open sourced it in a form of the <a href="https://github.com/DjangoGirls/wiki">Support Team Wiki</a>. From now on, 
                              everything about what we believe and how we work is open and public.

                              Last, but definitely not least, we incorporated the Django Girls Foundation during DjangoCon Europe 2015. We signed the papers, put the emoji sticker on them, 
                              and made it official. Django Girls is now a charity!

                              happened at EuroPython on the 22nd of July. We celebrated with 50 wonderful friends in a park, shared cupcakes, raised some glasses of sangria, and played a couple of games.

                              of our website were born. This happened thanks to amazing work of Marysia Lowas-Rzechonek & Kasia Siedlarek, both Django Girls attendees who 
                              wanted to learn more about Django by contributing to open source, as well as Becky Smith who mentored them, and Ania Warzecha who provided

                              Summer also kept us incredibly busy with a process of hiring Awesomeness Ambassador -- our first paid staff member! 
                              We spent literally hundreds of hours to recruit the best applicant: Lucie Daeye. Totally paid off. If you want to learn more about the

                              After the very busy summer, the time came to rest and recharge batteries a little bit. We let Lucie (the Awesomeness Ambassador) run the show for a
                              few weeks, and she did an amazing job. This is also when we realized how many of us were so close to burnout, and the decision of hiring our first paid staff member came at such a perfect time.

                              We made a jump from hosting our emails on a VPS provided generously by Megiteam to Google Apps, which became free to
                              us once we officially registered as charity. This turned out to be quite a project: moving 100+ email accounts and
                              tens of thousands of emails without interrupting anyone's organization! This wouldn't have happened so smoothly if

                      We don't have information on the number of people who became developers after Django Girls, and that information is difficult to gather. But it's an important metric. In this section, we're featuring interviews with some Django Girls attendees who've become professional developers since taking our workshop.

                          I wouldn't get involved in local meetups because of that. I wouldn't have that great opportunity to practise and get my code public,

                          I first heard of Django Girls when it was just starting out and I applied to the first workshop but wasn‚Äôt selected at the time. I applied again
                          when the workshop was in London in March 2015 and this time I got in. I had been learning to program on my own, but the workshop gave me the push
                          I needed to get more serious about it and actually try to get work as a developer. It was great to hear stories of other women who had become
                          developers despite not having studied CS at university and having already spent time working in other careers. It made me realise that I could do it too!
                          I‚Äôve also met lots of nice people through Django Girls and heard about different opportunities that I might not have been aware of otherwise.
