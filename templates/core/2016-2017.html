                   Django Girls Foundation is an initiative that aims to introduce women and girls who never coded before
                   to the world of technology and increase the diversity of the tech industry. We achieve this by organising
                   one-day workshops and inviting women to come and learn how to build the internet using HTML, CSS, Python and Django.
                   Django Girls is a volunteer run organisation with volunteers all over the world. Django Girls has two part-time paid staff
                   members and the support team (six awesome ladies who are also volunteers) to help provide support to all other volunteers.

                   This Impact Report aims to celebrate achievements of the Django Girls community in the past two years, and showcase
                   the incredible growth of the organization. For the first time ever, we're also presenting results of a survey
                   we conducted with almost 600 past Django Girls attendees to see if Django Girls Foundation actually achieves
                   the goal of our mission: to bring more women into tech industry!

                            We realised that there are certain things such as room decorations and swag (stickers, buttons and tattoos)
                            that are needed by all event organisers. We lowered the costs of decorations and swag for each event
                            by ordering them in bulk from suppliers and stock them in the Django Girls shop. Organisers then order
                            the Organizer Starter Kit from our shop for a small donation, and we donated a number of them to events
                            organised in developing countries. We are super excited that we managed to
                            introduce the Django Girls Starter Kit in 2016.

                This shows that Django Girls workshops are open and welcoming to women and girls irrespective of their age,

                of the women who responded to our survey stayed active in the tech industry after attending our workshops

                        The women continued learning in various ways; some on their own, enrolling for online coding courses or enrolling into universities.
                        These findings show that Django Girls is indeed increasing the number of women in the programming field, who will one
