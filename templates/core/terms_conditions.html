                    <p>By entering our site you are accepting these T&Cs</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>One other thing we need to say is that we do change these T&Cs from time to time and so you <b>must</b> always visit this page to see what changes we’ve made – we’ll assume that you have each time you contact us.</p>

                        <h3>Agreement</h3>

                        <li>you give us the right to publish the material you have submitted to us anywhere and for whatever reason we choose and we don’t have to pay you a fee or acknowledge you as the author;</li>

                    </ul>

                    <p>You acknowledge that we may retain copies of any and all communications made to us or using our System.</p>

                    <p>You agree that we can modify any information you send to us in any way and you agree that you have no moral right to be identified as the author of that information. Unless we have agreed them with you in advance, we don’t have to comply with any restrictions you put on our use of that information.</p>

                    <h3>Privacy and cookies</h3>

                    <p>We and you both agree that <a href="{% url "core:privacy-cookies" %}">our Privacy and Cookie Policy</a> forms part of these T&Cs.</p>

                    <h3>Disclaimers</h3>

                    <p>We have tried to make sure of the following things:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>that the Site will meet your needs;</li>
                        <li>that all the information we publish is correct, up to date and not misleading;</li>
                        <li>that the Site always works properly;</li>
                        <li>that the Site is fit for the purpose you need;</li>
                        <li>that the Site doesn’t infringe the rights of others;</li>
                        <li>that the Site will work with all systems; and</li>
                        <li>that the Site is secure,</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>but we can’t guarantee those things and, by agreeing to these T&Cs you are confirming that you accept that situation.</p>

                    <p>We take all reasonable effort to test material before placing it on the Site. In the very unlikely event of any loss, disruption or damage caused by material on the Site, we cannot be held responsible for any loss, disruption or damage to your data or computer system which may occur.</p>

                    <p>The only rights you have under these T&Cs are those mentioned within them. If a right is not mentioned (unless it is a right given to you under the laws of England and Wales) then it does not exist.</p>

                    <p>If you find an error, problem or bug when using any of the services or facilities we provide on the Site you agree either to notify us by submitting a pull request to the following <a href="https://github.com/DjangoGirls/djangogirls/">address</a> or to open an issue with us using the Site facilities. Whilst we will always endeavour to resolve any of the issues referred to in this paragraph we do not make any warranty that we will be able to achieve any specific outcome.</p>

                    <h3>Events</h3>

                    <p>Events organised through the Site are usually organised by third parties and not by us. Although we set out guidelines for all organisers to follow we have no control over whether those guidelines are followed or not. For this reason and to the maximum extent permitted by law, we accept no liability for any direct or indirect loss or damage, foreseeable or otherwise, including any indirect, consequential, special or exemplary damages arising from your booking or attendance at an Event or from anything arising from it.</p>

                    <p>You accept that all issues arising relating to an Event must be addressed to the Event Organiser.</p>

                    <h3>Problems</h3>

                    <p>We do our very best to make sure that you do not experience any problems when using the Site but if you do, you must tell us straight away.</p>

                    <p>We will do what we can to resolve the problem as quickly as we can and without charge to you if we agree that you have a problem.</p>

                    <h3>Availability of the site</h3>

                    <p>We never guarantee that the Site will be available all the time and if it’s not available for any reason we cannot be held responsible for anything you lose as a result.</p>

                    <p>We have the right to change the Site and the services it offers, suspend it or stop it at any time.</p>

                    <h3>Limitation of liability</h3>

                    <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, we accept no liability for any direct or indirect loss or damage, foreseeable or otherwise, including any indirect, consequential, special or exemplary damages arising from your use of the Site or any information contained in it.</p>

                    <p>You use the Site and its Content at your own risk.</p>

                    <p>Nothing in these T&Cs excludes or restricts our liability for death or personal injury resulting from any negligence or fraud on our part.</p>

                    <h3>Linking</h3>

                    <p>We don’t control any of the websites we link to and so we can’t be responsible for the content of such websites and we disclaim liability for any losses which come out of you using them.</p>

                    <p>Just because we link to a site does not mean that we endorse or recommend that site.</p>

                    <p>We can never guarantee that a link will work.</p>

                    <p>If you find any link we offer to be offensive, please let us know and we will consider removing it.</p>

                    <p>If you link to any other site using the Site then you understand that separate conditions will apply to those sites and that we have no control over those conditions – so you agree that you will read and understand them before using those sites.</p>

                    <p>If you wish to link to the Site you may link to our Home page on the following conditions:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>the link mustn’t damage our reputation;</li>
                        <li>the link must be fair and legal;</li>
                        <li>you can only link from a site that you own;</li>
                        <li>you can’t suggest that we are associated with you, endorse you and approve of you in any way; and</li>
                        <li>you mustn’t frame our Site on any other site.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>We always have the right to break any link you make even if we can’t give a reason for our decision.</p>

                    <h3>Modifications to these T&Cs & the site</h3>

                    <p>We’ve already said this, but we need to make it clear that these T&Cs will change from time to time and we don’t have the resources to let all our visitors know about the changes. As a result you MUST come back to this page to make sure that we haven’t changed these T&Cs and whenever you access the Site, you are confirming to us that you are aware of any changes.</p>

                    <p>We’ve also got the right to change the Site as and when we want to, but these T&Cs will still apply to any changes we make.</p>

                    <h3>General stuff</h3>

                    <ul>
                        <li><i>Operative Law</i> – these T&Cs are made under the laws of England and Wales and that is the only jurisdiction which can govern it.</li>

                        <li><i>Force Majeure</i> – if something outside our control happens and that prevents us from performing our services then you accept that we are not liable for the consequences of that failure (this includes such things as strikes, riots, fires, explosions, war, floods and so on). If such an event does happen we will tell you as soon as we are able and resume the service as soon as we can. If we cannot perform the service within a reasonable time, we can cancel it and if we do we will refund to you a fair and reasonable proportion of any payment you have made to us.</li>
                        <li><i>Unenforceability</i> – if a Court or other body says that any part of these T&Cs is unenforceable, the rest of them will stand.</li>
                        <li><i>Notices</i> – if either you or we need to give formal notice to the other it must be done by email to the address that each of us gives to the other from time to time.</li>
                        <li><i>Entire Agreement</i> – these T&Cs contain the entire understanding between us.</li>
