                                A: It really isn't, but we can understand why people might feel that way.
                                We've found that by having a women-only space for learning Python and Django,
                                women are more comfortable participating. See
                                <a href="http://jennifermann.ghost.io/minority-groups-in-tech-is-it-just-reverse-sexism/" target="_blank">this essay</a>

                                and Rails Girls to see what we mean. If you're having the knee-jerk reaction that
                                reaching out specifically to women hurts men, or hurts diversity efforts in
                                other areas, we encourage you to read

                                    Outreach programs don't divide our community. They incubate people which
                                    aren't comfortable to cope with us from the beginning on and grow our community
                                    in the long term.

                                    It doesn't really matter whose fault the initial discomfort is. Whether
                                    they're being over-sensitive (hint: <a href="http://therealkatie.net/blog/2012/mar/21/lighten-up/" target="_blank">they aren't</a>)
                                    or whether we're a bunch of a**holes (I know you aren't). The facts are these:
                                    if we want underrepresented people to enrich our community, we have to look for
                                    pragmatic ways to get them in. Even if the methods don't seem sound to us on the
                                    first sight to us.

                                    "Yes, but..." discussion don't help. PyLadies – and similar
                                    outreach groups – found a way that works. So be thankful to their organizers for doing this! And
                                    again: if you know of a better way, stop sh*tting on their approach and go for
                                    it! The world isn't binary; the more approaches, the more diversity, the better.

                                Also, not all Django Girls events are exclusive to women. Our organizer's manual
                                encourages organizers to use our materials to put on workshops for women <em>and</em>
                                for mixed-gender groups. We've also open-sourced all of our content, so if you
                                like our tutorial but don't want to put on a Django Girls event with it, feel
                                free to fork it, credit us for the content, but rebrand it into something that
                                works for your goals.

                                We don't want to get men <em>out</em> of programming; we just want to bring more women
                                <em>in</em>. There are already a lot of other bootcamps, workshops, meetups, and groups
                                that are "mixed gender," but are really mostly men. We've found that by limiting
                                our workshop to a majority of women participants, women are more comfortable
                                signing up, asking questions, getting involved, and even staying involved later
                                on. And that's a good thing!
