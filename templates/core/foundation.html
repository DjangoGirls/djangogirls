Django Girls Foundation is a Charitable Incorporated Organisation (“the CIO”). The goal of the foundation is to advance the education of the public in particular but not exclusively women in the subject of computer science by providing or assisting in the provision of programming workshops and educational material.

The foundation achieves that by:

- providing opportunities, such as free, accessible programming workshops for women and creating educational materials available online;
- promoting the image of female software engineer by driving advertising campaigns to encourage women to join the IT field and highlighting existing role models.
