                    <p>Django Girls is an initiative aimed at introducing women who have never coded before to the world of technology and increasing the diversity within the tech industry. We do that by organizing workshops and inviting women to join us to learn how to build the internet using HTML, CSS, Python and Django <strong>in a safe, friendly and inclusive environment.</strong>  </p>

                    <p class="tight-bottom">As a Django Girls Organizer, you make a commitement to foster and advance Django Girls values:</p>
