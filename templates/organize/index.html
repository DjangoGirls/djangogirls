                <p>Django Girls events are organized by groups of wonderful volunteers in cities all over the world.
                    Events are always non-profit and free for participants. We do not pay coaches, speakers or organizers.
                    Attendees don’t need any previous knowledge about programming and there are no age limitations.
                    All attendees need is a laptop and some curiosity!</p>

                <p>As of 2020, Django Girls workshops can only be held remotely. This is due to the ongoing Global Pandemic, and allows workshops continue while ensuring the safety of our organisers, volunteers and participants. We will review this decision in 2021, and hope to also allow for in-person workshops as soon as it is safe to do so. </p>

                <h3>In-Person Workshops</h3>

                <p>An in-person workshop is any workshop where participants, coaches, and organisers, all meet in the
                    same physical location. Participants can work together in teams and support from coaches is done face-to-face.</p>

                <p>These workshops should only be conducted when it is safe to do so, and you may be
                    asked in your application to provide evidence of why you feel this type of worshops is safe, and
                    what, if any, safety measures you will be putting in place.</p>

                <p>If you are not sure if it is safe to hold an in-person workshop, you might prefer to organise a remote workshop instead.</p>

                <h3>Remote Workshops</h3>

                <p>A remote workshop is a workshop conducted online, where participants, coaches and organisers are in
                    different physical locations.</p>

                <p>This type of workshop may be more suitable in situations where it might not be safe, affordable, or
                    logistically possible to host a workshop in-person, or where difficulties finding sponsorship would be a barrier to running to the workshop in-person. Remote workshops also allow for more flexibility
                    with the location of your attendees and coaches.</p>
