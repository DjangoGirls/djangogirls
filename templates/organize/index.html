                        Django Girls events are organized by groups of wonderful volunteers in cities all over the world.
                        Events are always non-profit and free for participants. We <strong><u>DO NOT PAY</u></strong> coaches, speakers or organizers.
                        Attendees don’t need any previous knowledge about programming and there are no age limitations.
                        All attendees need is a laptop and some curiosity!

                        As of 2020, Django Girls workshops can only be held remotely. This is due to the ongoing Global Pandemic,
                        and allows workshops continue while ensuring the safety of our organisers, volunteers and participants.
                        We will review this decision in 2021, and hope to also allow for in-person workshops as soon as it is safe to do so.

                        An in-person workshop is any workshop where participants, coaches, and organisers, all meet in the
                        same physical location. Participants can work together in teams and support from coaches is done face-to-face.

                        A remote workshop is a workshop conducted online, where participants, coaches and organisers are in
                        different physical locations.

                        This type of workshop may be more suitable in situations where it might not be safe, affordable, or
                        logistically possible to host a workshop in-person, or where difficulties finding sponsorship would
                        be a barrier to running to the workshop in-person. Remote workshops also allow for more flexibility
                        with the location of your attendees and coaches.
